---

Arterial's Explore Mode allows you to leverage our simulation features _in reverse_: instead of simulating a parcel to find out what can be done, you can find parcels that fit specific (abstract) criteria.

Explore mode is available from the [Explore page](https://arterial.design/app/explore) on your Arterial dashboard.

## Overlays

Similar to the [Datasets](/essentials/datasets) page, overlays allow you to visualize and filter actual dataset values on the map. You can use the selector in the top-right corner of the page to choose which dataset to overlay; the map will then update to show the corresponding values.

## Parcel Searching

Explore Mode includes powerful mechanics to help you locate parcels that fit specific criteria. You can switch into Parcel Mode by clicking the <Icon icon="land-plot" color="#FFF" /> **Parcel View** toggle on the left-hand side of the map.

<Info>
	Parcel Mode allows you to select and simulate parcels on the fly instead of
	creating a project from the dashboard.
</Info>

To filter parcels, you can use the <Icon icon="filter" color="#FFF" /> **Filter Parcels** button in the top-left corner of the map. This will open a modal with a prompt for a set of clauses to filter by.

### Precedence Analysis

You can quickly filter parcels out based on their policy compliance using the datasets under **Precedence**. These datasets are linked to Arterial's [policy algorithms](/essentials/policies), and will find all the clusters of parcels where the prompted criteria are met.

You can use the _Planning Arguments_ key to filter parcels based on their ability to have variances sought for them—Arterial will conduct HBU studies to search for the places with the highest probability of success.

<Info>
	Generally, filtering on Planning Arguments is best used by describing the type
	of project you'd like to build. More keys are available (such as policy
	references and site context) for more specific searches.
</Info>

### Parcel Geometry

You can also filter on the parcels themselves, using the **Parcel Geometry** key. Currently, we support filtering on _area_ and _frontage_ of parcels—the most common types of geometric constraints in land development.

### Massing Templates

In addition, you can quickly filter parcels based on geometric and policy constraints by using the **Template Compatibility** key. You'll be able to select from a list of Arterial (and your organization's) pre-defined templates—Arterial will run through its policy algorithms in the background.

### MLS criteria

Arterial has a constant stream of land economics information in addition to all of its policy data; both MLS Leasing and Sales information can be used to filter parcels. You can use the **MLS Leasing** and **MLS Sales** keys to take advantage.

Arterial will average the values of commonly-used keys (such as the latest price) and apply the forecasted values across all parcels on the map; you'll be able to filter based on these predicted scores.
