All of Arterial's data can be shared and exported in a variety of formats; [Massings](/essentials/massings) can be exported as 3D models, Pro Formas, and PDFs, while [Datasets](/essentials/datasets) can be exported as CSVs.

You can also share your [Projects](/essentials/projects) with other users directly.

## Pro Forma Exporting

<Info>
	Please reach out to [rishi@arterial.design](mailto:rishi@arterial.design) to
	request a custom import of your pro forma spreadsheet. If you're a part of our
	Slack, please DM Rishi directly.
</Info>

Arterial can export massing and pricing information into a spreadsheet of your choosing—we have our own custom set of compilation tools that allow our servers to generate them in your own formats.

On any massing page, you can click on <Icon icon="cloud-download" color="#FFF" /> **Export** <Icon icon="arrow-right"/> <Icon icon="table" color='#FFF'/> **Generate Pro Forma** to generate one.

## PDF Exporting

Similar to Pro Forma exporting, Arterial can generate clean reports of your full massing analysis—down to the unit layouts, entitlements, and financial projections.

On any massing page, you can click on <Icon icon="cloud-download" color="#FFF" /> **Export** <Icon icon="arrow-right"/> <Icon icon="file-text" color='#FFF'/> **Generate PDF** to generate one.

The modal that pops up allows you to select which analyses you'd like to include—and generate new entitlement studies on the fly.

## Database Exporting

In database views (either inside a project or in [Explore Mode](/workflows/parcel-search)), you can export a radius of all the information in the current view as a CSV.

Most datasets will also allow you to fine-tune the columns that are exported; all nested values will be shared as well.
