## Variance Simulation

Variance simulation allows you to test the impact of policy changes on your project. This is particularly useful for understanding how different zoning or policy scenarios could affect your development plans.

You can get started by clicking <Icon icon="circle-fading-plus" color="#FFF" /> **Simulate Variance** in the project sidebar. You'll be prompted to select overrides for specific policies (i.e. zoning by-laws) that you'd like to simulateâ€”the rest of the process is the same as [creating a project](/essentials/projects).
