Entitlements in Arterial allow you to quickly compare the as-of-right regulations to your proposed massing, and based on precedence, find the probabiliy of success.

A specific entitlement is simply a question about a massing that can be linked to policy â€” each massing has a large set of potential entitlements that can be simulated, and each one is composed of:

- **Policy reference**: what the entitlement is trying to validate (e.g. maximum height, transition guidelines, etc.)
- **Policy range**: the maximum and minimum extents as laid out in as-of-right policies (i.e. zoning & official plans)
- **Design range**: the extent to which the typology needs to be influenced (in non-policy documents)

From these values, Arterial can provide information on:

- **Compliance**: whether the massing meets AOR specifications
- **Precedents**: the number of similar applications that have been approved in a particular radius
- **Probability of variance success**: how likely your project is to be built, given policy restrictions

Arterial comes with a large set of useful entitlement simulations informed by customer feedback, and full simulations can be done with _one click_.

## Quickstart

<Steps titleSize="h3">
<Step title="Massing Creation">

Entitlements are based on a massing typology; unit types are not required for most entitlement simulations, but can be used to inform designs.

<Info>
	See [Massing](/essentials/massing) for more information on how to create a
	massing.
</Info>

</Step>

<Step title="Entitlement Simulation">

Once a massing is created, navigate to the <Icon icon="book-up-2"  /> **Entitlements** tab in the sidebar or in the bottom-left legend of the massing page.

All of the applicable entitlement simulation possibilities will be listed; click <Icon icon="book-up" color="#FFF" /> **Investigate** to run the simulation (this may take a few seconds).

</Step>

<Step title="Analysis">

Arterial will automatically update with the entitlement simulation results; clicking into an entitlement will reveal the analysis behind the simulation's results.

If the massing is not AOR compliant, you can use the <Icon icon="search" color="#FFF"/> **View Precedence Search** button to look at development precedence in the area.
