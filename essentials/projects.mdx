Projects are how Arterial organizes your work. They associate _parcels_ with policies, massings, and datasets.

Creating a project consists of a few steps:

1. **Parcel selection**:
2. **Supplemental policies**:
3. **Project targets**:
4. **Massing setup**:

## Quickstart

<Steps titleSize="h3">
<Step title="Parcel Selection">

Projects can be created from either an address or via a [parcel search](/workflows/parcel-search), and can be created from the [project dashboard](https://arterial.design/app/overview), [explore page](https://arterial.design/app/explore), or a project dataset page.

To begin creating a project, you can select a set of parcels from any supported map above.

</Step>
<Step title="Supplemental Policies" >

<Info>
	Policies and project details are optional and can be added later. If you want
	to [skip straight](#massing-setup) to the massing steps, use the **"Quick
	Analyze"** option.
</Info>

After selecting parcels, Arterial will automatically load in the relevant policies & regulations for the area. In certain cases, policy maps may not be digitized or are dynamic; Arterial will prompt you to fill out the relevant values.

		allowfullscreen
		className="w-full aspect-video"
	></iframe>
</Frame>

These policy values inform the regulations that Arterial is able to find; for all necessary manual values, we'll provide the maps and information you need to fill out the correct information.

</Step>
<Step title="Project Details">
The regulations Arterial picks up on inform the _as-of-right_ regulations for the selected parcels; in other words, the universe of possibilities for your project.

Arterial will ask for the details of the project you'd like to buildâ€”with parameters resting in the as-of-right range. This final step allows Arterial to find the policies that are specific to your _project_, not just the land.

<Info>
	To simulate a project that is not allowed as-of-right, you can use the
	[variant simulation](/workflows/upzoning) feature to test policies.

</Step>
<Step title="Massing Setup">

The final step of project creation is to set up an initial massing profile; this is a 3D model of the project that you'd like to build.

After selecting either a ready-made template or a blank starter, you can click on the setback lines provided on the map to create your massing profile.
