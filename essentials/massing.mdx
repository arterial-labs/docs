Massing Simulations help visualize the policies and datasets that Arterial has access toâ€”and allows you to derive insights about your project's potential!

A massing on Arterial is composed of two key components:

- **Typology**: a set of storeys and design elements that define the building's envelope
- **Layout**: the types of units and floor plate-level arrangements within the building

Based on these elements, Arterial can provide insights into:

- **Floor Plate Designs**: rectangular or irregular floor plates with your selected units, optimized for revenue
- **Entitlements**: the probability of a project being approved & potential development precedents
- **Design Details**: basic GFA/GLA information, estimated amenity spaces, and other design elements
- **Finances**: unit rents/sales information, NOI/estimated cap rate, returns, valuation, etc.
- **Construction Costing**: the estimated cost of construction based on Arterial's material modelling

## Quickstart

<Steps titleSize="h3">
<Step title="Geometry Setup">

All massing simulations are tied to a project, and can be created by navigating to the <Icon icon="cuboid" color="#FFF" /> **Massing** tab in the sidebar.

When you click <Icon icon="plus" color="#FFF" /> **New Massing**, you'll be prompted to select your massing's setback lines; these are the lines that inform the building's envelope.

You can select the _type_ of setback using <Icon icon="map-pin" color="#FFF" /> **Select**; click on the greyed out lines on the map to the left to select them.

<Info>
	These lines will be autofilled based on the other massings in your project;
	click <Icon icon="pencil" color="#FFF" /> **Reset** to change the lines.
</Info>

Once all lines are selected, the building envelope will be generated in gray on the map.

</Step>
<Step title="Template Selection">

Arterial has a large selection of pre-defined, customizable massing templates that can be used to speed up your ideation; use the <Icon icon="building" color="#FFF"/> **Select Development Typology** dropdown to chooose one.

<Info>
	You can start from scratch by using one of the **General Templates**,
	highlighted at the top. To add in massing details, skip to the [design
	documentation](#massing-design)
</Info>

Once you've selected both, hit <Icon icon="arrow-right" color="#FFF" /> **Continue** to create the massing.

</Step>

<Step title="Unit & Layout Setup">

    Most templates come with pre-defined amenity spaces for internal layout simulation; you'll need to select the unit types that you'd like to use in the <Icon icon="proportions" color="#FFF" /> **Layout** tab.
