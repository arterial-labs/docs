Datasets are the counterpart to [Policies](/essentials/policies) in Arterial's analysis process. They represent sources of truth that are used to source relevant values from policies—and normally are drawn from maps and private city datasets.

Each dataset can be viewed on its own, or combined with parcels to seek out new information (see [Explore Mode](/workflows/parcel-search))—and every project on Arterial will automatically have the relevant values attached to it.

## Quickstart

<Steps titleSize="h3">
<Step title="Project Creation">

Projects are how Arterial analyzes specific datasets relevant to a set of parcels; you can create a project from the [project dashboard](https://arterial.design/app/overview), [explore page](https://arterial.design/app/explore), or a project dataset page.

See [Projects](/essentials/projects) for more information on how to create a project.

<Step title="Dataset Overview">

You can view all the datasets Arterial has collected in the <Icon icon="layers-2" color="#FFF" /> **Datasets** tab in the sidebar.

## Navigating Datasets

### Dataset Types

**Point Datasets** are datasets that refer to a particular point or document on a map—like development and permitting applications. They show up as large circles on the map: each one can be clicked to zoom in directly.

**Polygon Datasets**

### Filtering

All datasets can be filtered by a set of properties from the legend in the bottom-right corner. Each of the highlighted properties can be clicked to exclusively show those values—the colour corresponds to the colour of the points or polygons on the map.

To change the property that's being filtered on, you can click the dropdown.

### Parcel Mode

Clicking the <Icon icon="land-plot" color="#FFF" /> **Parcel Mode** button will allow you to view the dataset with a parcel overlay. This will show you the parcels that are relevant to the current map context and allow you to create a project directly from the map (and search for parcels that fit specific criteria).

	See [Explore Mode](/workflows/parcel-search) for more information on how to
	use the parcel search features.
