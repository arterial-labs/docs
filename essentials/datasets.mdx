description: "Learn to interpret sources of truth in Arterial"
---

Datasets are the counterpart to [Policies](/essentials/policies) in Arterial's analysis process. They represent sources of truth that are used to source relevant values from policies—and normally are drawn from maps and private city datasets.

Each dataset can be viewed on its own, or combined with parcels to seek out new information (see [Explore Mode](/workflows/parcel-search))—and every project on Arterial will automatically have the relevant values attached to it.

## Quickstart

<Steps titleSize="h3">
<Step title="Project Creation">

Projects are how Arterial analyzes specific datasets relevant to a set of parcels; you can create a project from the [project dashboard](https://arterial.design/app/overview), [explore page](https://arterial.design/app/explore), or a project dataset page.

See [Projects](/essentials/projects) for more information on how to create a project.

<Step title="Dataset Overview">

You can view all the datasets Arterial has collected in the <Icon icon="layers-2" color="#FFF" /> **Datasets** tab in the sidebar.

	></iframe>
</Frame>

</Step>

<Step title="Filtering">

You can step through the datasets and filter them by a set of properties from the legend in the bottom-right corner. Each of the highlighted properties can be clicked to exclusively show those values—the colour corresponds to the colour of the points or polygons on the map.

## Navigating Datasets

### Dataset Types

**Point Datasets** are datasets that refer to a particular point or document on a map—like development and permitting applications. They show up as large circles on the map: each one can be clicked to zoom in directly.

**Polygon Datasets** are datasets that represent areas or zones on a map—such as zoning districts, official plan designations, or neighbourhood boundaries. These appear as colored regions that can be clicked to view their associated information and regulations.

You can control which information is displayed by using the dropdown for the overlaid text in the top left corner of the map interface. This allows you to customize what dataset information is prominently shown as you navigate the map.

### Filtering

All datasets can be filtered by a set of properties from the legend in the bottom-right corner. Each of the highlighted properties can be clicked to exclusively show those values—the colour corresponds to the colour of the points or polygons on the map.

To change the property that's being filtered on, you can click the dropdown.

### Parcel Mode

Clicking the <Icon icon="land-plot" color="#FFF" /> **Parcel Mode** button will allow you to view the dataset with a parcel overlay. This will show you the parcels that are relevant to the current map context and allow you to create a project directly from the map (and search for parcels that fit specific criteria).

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="How often are datasets refreshed?">

All datasets are refreshed on a weekly basis across all supported cities. We have automated systems that collect data from municipal, provincial, and state authorities, ensuring that development applications, zoning changes, and other critical information stays current.

Each dataset update is processed and integrated into our analysis engine automatically—whenever you use Arterial, you can be confident that you're working with the most up-to-date information available.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I request a new dataset?">

If you have a dataset that you would like to see added to Arterial, you can send us the relevant information and we'll evaluate it for inclusion in our database. We prioritize datasets that provide broad value across multiple projects and jurisdictions.

<Info>
	To request new datasets or voice support for new features, send an email to
	[rishi@arterial.design](mailto:rishi@arterial.design) or send Rishi a message
	on Slack.
</Info>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I know if a dataset is accurate?">

All of Arterial's datasets are sourced directly from official municipal and government sources. We maintain data lineage and source attribution for every dataset, which you can view by clicking on individual data points or polygons on the map.

In cases where data may be incomplete or outdated, we'll clearly indicate this in the dataset description and provide information about when the data was last updated.
